Our office hours are 45-minute-long (not quite an hour) live chat sessions that cover all things Redpanda. We will discuss early features, latest product updates, live demos and more. Keep up on what's new, grow your knowledge, add to your skills. We'll also conduct live Q&A and  occasionally host quizzes, games & contests!

## Office Hours – March 22nd, 2023 11am PST

Got questions? We can’t wait to answer them! Welcome to our first Redpanda community office hour! 

We are super excited to have as our first guest Alejandro Escobar, who will discuss the work on the Helm Chart for Redpanda. He & his team has been working on the project for about a year now and making steady improvements. He mentioned  "Deploying on kubernetes is hard, the difficulty we have been working hard to make available a helm chart, so you can get a production ready quickly to get you started." 

And we will open up the forum for Q&A or discussion! Stay till the end – we have a little surprise for you! See you there!
